The electric vehicle manufacturer delivered 435,000 vehicles during the quarter, representing a 27% increase year-over-year. CEO Elon Musk stated that the company's gross margin improved to 18.2%, driven by cost reductions in battery production and manufacturing efficiency gains.

Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney raised his price target for Tesla from $250 to $305, citing improved production capacity at the Austin Gigafactory and strong demand in the Chinese market. Tesla's operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.3 billion, while capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion.

The company's energy storage business also showed significant growth, with deployments of 4.0 GWh in Q3 2024, up from 1.5 GWh in the same period last year. Tesla's automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits stood at 16.3%, compared to 14.6% in Q2 2024.
